Description: LTTng control and utility programs
 The LTTng project aims at providing highly efficient tracing tools for Linux.
 Its tracers help tracking down performance issues and debugging problems
 involving multiple concurrent processes and threads. Tracing across multiple
 systems is also possible.
 .
 This package provides the unified interface to control both the LTTng kernel
 and userspace (UST) tracers.
