 * Takes a pointer x and transform it so we can use it to access members
 * without a function call. Here an example:
 *
 *    #define GET_SIZE(x) LTTNG_REF(x)->size
 *
 *    struct { int size; } s;
 *
 *    printf("size : %d\n", GET_SIZE(&s));
 *
 * For this example we can't use something like this for compatibility purpose
 * since this will fail:
 *
 *    #define GET_SIZE(x) x->size;
 *
 * This is mostly use for the compatibility layer of lttng-tools. See
 * poll/epoll for a good example. Since x can be on the stack or allocated
 * memory using malloc(), we must use generic accessors for compat in order to
 * *not* use a function to access members and not the variable name.
