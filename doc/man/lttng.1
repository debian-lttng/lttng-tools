.SH "DESCRIPTION"

.PP
The LTTng project aims at providing highly efficient tracing tools for Linux.
It's tracers help tracking down performance issues and debugging problems
involving multiple concurrent processes and threads. Tracing across multiple
systems is also possible.

The \fBlttng\fP command line tool from the lttng-tools package is used to control
both kernel and user-space tracing. Every interactions with the tracer should
be done by this tool or by the liblttng-ctl provided with the lttng-tools
package.

LTTng uses a session daemon (lttng-sessiond(8)), acting as a tracing registry,
which allows you to interact with multiple tracers (kernel and user-space)
inside the same container, a tracing session. Traces can be gathered from the
kernel and/or instrumented applications (lttng-ust(3)). Aggregating and reading
those traces is done using the babeltrace(1) text viewer.

We introduce the notion of \fBtracing domains\fP which is essentially a type of
tracer (kernel or user space for now). In the future, we could see a third
tracer being for instance an hypervisor. For some commands, you'll need to
specify on which domain the command applies (-u or -k). For instance, enabling
a kernel event, you must specify the kernel domain to the command so we know
for which tracer this event is for.

In order to trace the kernel, the session daemon needs to be running as root.
LTTng provides the use of a \fBtracing group\fP (default: tracing). Whomever is
in that group can interact with the root session daemon and thus trace the
kernel. Session daemons can co-exist meaning that you can have a session daemon
running as Alice that can be used to trace her applications along side with a
root daemon or even a Bob daemon. We highly recommend to start the session
daemon at boot time for stable and long term tracing.

Every user-space applications instrumented with lttng-ust(3), will
automatically register to the session daemon. This feature gives you the
ability to list available traceable applications and tracepoints on a per user
basis. (See \fBlist\fP command).

.SH "COMMANDS"

.TP
\fBadd-context\fP
.nf
Add context to event(s) and/or channel(s).

A context is basically extra information appended to a channel. For instance,
you could ask the tracer to add the PID information for all events in a
channel. You can also add performance monitoring unit counters (perf PMU) using
the perf kernel API).

For example, this command will add the context information 'prio' and two perf
counters (hardware branch misses and cache misses), to all events in the trace
data output:

# lttng add-context \-k \-t prio \-t perf:branch-misses \-t perf:cache-misses

Please take a look at the help (\-h/\-\-help) for a detailed list of available
contexts.

If no channel is given (\-c), the context is added to all channels. Otherwise
the context will be added only to the given channel (\-c).

If \fB\-s, \-\-session\fP is omitted, the session name is taken from the .lttngrc
file.

.IP "\fBcalibrate\fP"
.nf
Quantify LTTng overhead

The LTTng calibrate command can be used to find out the combined average
overhead of the LTTng tracer and the instrumentation mechanisms used. This
overhead can be calibrated in terms of time or using any of the PMU performance
counter available on the system.

For now, the only calibration implemented is that of the kernel function
instrumentation (kretprobes).

* Calibrate kernel function instrumentation

Let's use an example to show this calibration. We use an i7 processor with 4
general-purpose PMU registers. This information is available by issuing dmesg,
looking for "generic registers".

This sequence of commands will gather a trace executing a kretprobe hooked on
an empty function, gathering PMU counters LLC (Last Level Cache) misses
information (see lttng add-context \-\-help to see the list of available PMU
counters).

# lttng create calibrate-function
# lttng enable-event calibrate \-\-kernel \-\-function lttng_calibrate_kretprobe
# lttng add-context \-\-kernel \-t perf:LLC-load-misses \-t perf:LLC-store-misses \\
                  \-t perf:LLC-prefetch-misses
# lttng start
# for a in $(seq 1 10); do \\
        lttng calibrate \-\-kernel \-\-function;
  done
# lttng destroy
# babeltrace $(ls \-1drt ~/lttng-traces/calibrate-function-* | tail \-n 1)

The output from babeltrace can be saved to a text file and opened in a
spreadsheet (e.g. oocalc) to focus on the per-PMU counter delta between
consecutive "calibrate_entry" and "calibrate_return" events. Note that these
counters are per-CPU, so scheduling events would need to be present to account
for migration between CPU. Therefore, for calibration purposes, only events
staying on the same CPU must be considered.

The average result, for the i7, on 10 samples:

                          Average     Std.Dev.
perf_LLC_load_misses:       5.0       0.577
perf_LLC_store_misses:      1.6       0.516
perf_LLC_prefetch_misses:   9.0      14.742

As we can notice, the load and store misses are relatively stable across runs
(their standard deviation is relatively low) compared to the prefetch misses.
We can conclude from this information that LLC load and store misses can be
accounted for quite precisely, but prefetches within a function seems to behave
too erratically (not much causality link between the code executed and the CPU
prefetch activity) to be accounted for.

.IP "\fBcreate\fP [NAME] [OPTIONS]
.nf
Create tracing session.

A tracing session contains channel(s) which contains event(s). It is domain
agnostic meaning that you can enable channels and events for either the
user-space tracer and/or the kernel tracer. It acts like a container
aggregating multiple tracing sources.

On creation, a \fB.lttngrc\fP file is created in your $HOME directory
containing the current session name. If NAME is omitted, a session name is
automatically created having this form: 'auto-yyyymmdd-hhmmss'.

If no \fB\-o, \-\-output\fP is specified, the traces will be written in
$HOME/lttng-traces.

.IP

.IP "\fBenable-consumer\fP [-u|-k] [URL] [OPTIONS]"
.nf
Enable a consumer for the tracing session and domain.

By default, every tracing session has a consumer attached to it using the local
filesystem as output. The trace is written in $HOME/lttng-traces. This command
allows the user to specify a specific URL after the session was created for a
specific domain. If no domain is specified, the consumer is applied on all
domains.

Without options, the behavior is to enable a consumer to the current URL. The
default URL is the local filesystem at the path of the session mentioned above.

The enable-consumer feature supports both local and network transport. You must
have a running \fBlttng-relayd(8)\fP for network transmission or any other daemon
that can understand the streaming protocol of LTTng.

.B URL FORMAT:

proto://[HOST|IP][:PORT1[:PORT2]][/TRACE_PATH]

Supported protocols are (proto):
> file://...
        Local filesystem full path.

> net://...
        This will use the default network transport layer which is TCP for both
        control (PORT1) and data port (PORT2). The default ports are
        respectively 5342 and 5343. Note that net[6]:// is not yet supported.

> tcp[6]://...
        Can only be used with -C and -D together

NOTE: IPv6 address MUST be enclosed in brackets '[]' (rfc2732)

.B EXAMPLES:

$ lttng enable-consumer -u net://192.168.1.42

Uses TCP and default ports for user space tracing (-u) where the IP address
above is the destination machine where the traces will be streamed and a
\fBlttng-relayd(8)\fP is listening.
.fi

.IP "\fBenable-event\fP NAME[,NAME2,...] [-k|-u] [OPTIONS]"
.nf
Enable tracing event

A tracing event is always assigned to a channel. If \fB\-c, \-\-channel\fP is
omitted, a default channel named '\fBchannel0\fP' is created and the event is
added to it. For the user-space tracer, using \fB\-a, \-\-all\fP is the same as
using the wildcard "*".

If \fB\-s, \-\-session\fP is omitted, the session name is taken from the .lttngrc
file.
.fi

.B OPTIONS:

\-c, \-\-channel NAME
        Apply on channel name
\-a, \-\-all
        Enable all tracepoints and syscalls. This actually enable a single
        wildcard event "*".
\-k, \-\-kernel
        Apply for the kernel tracer
\-u, \-\-userspace
        Apply for the user-space tracer

\-\-tracepoint
        Tracepoint event (default)
        - userspace tracer supports wildcards at end of string. Don't forget to
        quote to deal with bash expansion.
        e.g.:
        "*"
        "app_component:na*"
\-\-loglevel NAME
        Tracepoint loglevel range from 0 to loglevel. Listed in the help (\-h).
\-\-loglevel-only NAME
        Tracepoint loglevel (only this loglevel).

        The loglevel or loglevel-only options should be combined with a
        tracepoint name or tracepoint wildcard.
\-\-probe [addr | symbol | symbol+offset]
        Dynamic probe. Addr and offset can be octal (0NNN...), decimal (NNN...)
        or hexadecimal (0xNNN...)
\-\-function [addr | symbol | symbol+offset]
        Dynamic function entry/return probe. Addr and offset can be octal
        (0NNN...), decimal (NNN...) or hexadecimal (0xNNN...)
\-\-syscall
        System call event. Enabling syscalls tracing (kernel tracer), you will
        not be able to disable them with disable-event. This is a known
        limitation. You can disable the entire channel to do the trick.

\-\-filter 'expression'
        Set a filter on a newly enabled event. Filter expression on event
        fields, event recording depends on evaluation. Only specify on first
        activation of a given event within a session. Filter only allowed when
        enabling events within a session before tracing is started. If the
        filter fails to link with the event within the traced domain, the event
        will be discarded. Currently, filter is only implemented for the
        user-space tracer.

        Expression examples:

        'intfield > 500 && intfield < 503'
        '(stringfield == "test" || intfield != 10) && intfield > 33'
        'doublefield > 1.1 && intfield < 5.3'

        Wildcards are allowed at the end of strings:
        'seqfield1 == "te*"'
        In string literals, the escape character is a '\\'. Use '\\*' for
        the '*' character, and '\\\\' for the '\\' character.
