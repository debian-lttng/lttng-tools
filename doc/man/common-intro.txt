The https://lttng.org/[_Linux Trace Toolkit: next generation_] is an
open-source software package used for correlated tracing of the Linux
kernel, user applications, and user libraries.

LTTng consists of Linux kernel modules (for Linux kernel tracing) and
dynamically loaded libraries (for user application and library tracing).
