LTTng-Tools Coding Style

Last Update: 23/07/2012

C Style:
-------------

The coding style used for this project follows the the Linux kernel guide
lines, except that brackets "{", "}" should typically be used even for
single-line if/else statements. Please refer to:

- doc/kernel-CodingStyle.txt (copied from Linux 3.4.4 git tree).

- Linux kernel scripts/checkpatch.pl for a script which verify the patch
  coding style.

Error handling:
-------------

We ask to use one single return point in a function. For that, we uses the
"goto" statement for the error handling creating one single point for error
handling and return code. See the following example:

int some_function(...)
{
	int ret;
	[...]

	if (ret != 0) {
		goto error;
	}

	[...]
error:
	return ret;
}

Commenting:
-------------

Every function MUST have a comment above it even if the function is trivial.

Please add non-trivial comments/documentation as much as you can in the code.
Poor comments WILL be rejected upon merging so please pay attention to this
details because we do!
