LTTng-Tools Coding Style

Last Update: 23/07/2012

C Style:
-------------

The coding style used for this project follows the the Linux kernel guide
lines, except that brackets "{", "}" should typically be used even for
single-line if/else statements. Please refer to:

- doc/kernel-CodingStyle.txt (copied from Linux 3.4.4 git tree).

- Linux kernel scripts/checkpatch.pl for a script which verify the patch
  coding style.

Commenting:
-------------

Every function MUST have a comment above it even if the function is trivial.

Please add non-trivial comments/documentation as much you can in the code. Poor
comments WILL be rejected upon merging so please pay attention to this details
because we do!
